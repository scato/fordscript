  - JavaScript syntax files were copied from jsfax (https://github.com/mobl/mobl)
  - Inspired by Douglas Crockford's ideas about JavaScript (http://javascript.crockford.com/)
  - Inspired by ECMAScript 4 (and ActionScript 2 as such)

FordScript adds type hinting and class definitions to JavaScript. The result is converted back to JavaScript using Stratego/J. The "augment" keyword is added for type augmentation (see Crockford). Another keyword, "prototype" is added for prototype based programming.
